🔧 Customization & Extensibility

    Add new languages by integrating interpreters or containers (e.g. WASM‑compiled runtimes)

    Write custom Monaco/CodeMirror extensions (e.g. auto-formatters, code completions)

    Theming: Light, dark, or custom themes via CSS / Monaco theme files

    Storage & sharing: Plug in cloud storage providers or version-control backends

🙌 Credits & Acknowledgements

    Based on Monaco Editor (used in VS Code) or CodeMirror

    Inspired by online IDEs such as Repl.it, CodeSandbox, and JSFiddle

    Uses sandboxing techniques from Docker / Node.js worker threads
